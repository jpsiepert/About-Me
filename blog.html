		<h3>Angularjs</h3>
		<h4>View-Controller-Serivce</h4>
		<p class="blog-text">There are three components of Angular I want to talk about today. These are the VIEW, the CONTROLLER, and the SERVICE.</p>
		
		<p class="blog-text">Let's start with the VIEW. The way I think about view, is it is what is &#34;viewed&#34; in the browser. The view is written with HTML and within the HTML it has the &#34;ng&#34; classes to bring Angular to the user.</p>
		
		<p class="blog-text">The controller is the interpretor. The controller can understand both what the view and the service are telling it.</p>
		
		<p> class="blog-text"The service is the behind the scenes part of the app. This is where all the heavy lifting and functions are, written mostly in JavaScript.</p>
		
		<p class="blog-text">Now, the service and the view cannot comprehend each other. They are speaking different languages. Without the controller there would be no way for the service and the view to communicate with each other and pass data back and forth.</p>
		
		<p class="blog-text">You may be thinking, if the controller and the view can understand each other, why even use a service? Why have a middleman between these two components.</p>
		
		<p class="blog-text">Let me try to paint a picture. In the view, you have all your basic HTML, as well as links to our js files, our cdn's as well as our style sheet. There is a LOT of information in our view. Our view needs to know what all of that is doing, and make sure to load the page properly. It is the face of our business. Now, as the face of our business it doesn't always have time to learn a new language. Enter the controller, or our intepretor. Our interpretor is going to make sure that the functionality of our view stays in tact. Our controller needs to look clean and be easily readable for the view. To do this, we have our service communicate with the servers and store the information being processed. The service needs to talk with the data coming from the servers and other web applications and is not so concerned with how the view chooses to take that information.</p>
		
		<p class="blog-text">SO, our controller uses this handy feature called $scope. Our controller can already communicate with our service without any extra language because they are both js files. However, our view is, as previously stated, html, and doesn't use this &#34;js&#34; language. $scope allows the view and the controller to both understand what information is being passed back and forth.</p>
		
		<p class="blog-text">With $scope, our controller can take information a user passed in, enter it into their data, and then pass it to the service. The service can then take that information, pass it to the servers or database where the information needs to be pushed to or pulled from in the way the server is looking to receive it, then give that data back to the controller, who can then tell the view the information is back and to display to the user.</p>
		
		<p class="blog-text">There is a lot more that goes into how the service and the controller communicate with each other and with outside services, but that is for another time. For now, just know, when you are on a website, trying to find information, perhaps in a search box, the view is taking what you, the user put in, giving it to the controller, who passes it to the service. The service then takes that information to the server/database in the way the server is expecting it. The server returns to the service the data, where the service can then relay the information back to the controller who can then give that info to the view who displays to the user.</p>
		
		<p class="blog-text">This is a LOT of processing that just happened, and we, the user, only see the results appear to us in the blink of an eye!</p>
